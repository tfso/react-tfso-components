# react-tfso-components

# Development

- Run `npm ci` and `npm start` in both the lib folder and the example folder
- To build, run `npm run build` in lib
- Run linter before release `npm run lint`
- To make a new release, bump the version in package.json and run `npm publish`. This will publish directly to github (as opposed to npm)
- Deploy examples to github pages by running `npm run deploy`
